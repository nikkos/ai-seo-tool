## Brand Overview

- **Brand name:** Acme HR Software
- **Industry / niche:** B2B SaaS — HR and people management software for SMBs
- **Website:** acme.com
- **Target audience:** HR managers and operations leads at companies with 50–500 employees. They are moderately technical, time-poor, and focused on practical outcomes over theory.
- **Content language:** English ← change this to Greek, Spanish, French, etc. to output in that language automatically

---

## Tone & Personality

Describe the brand's voice in 3–5 adjectives:

- Clear and direct — no fluff, no filler sentences
- Practical — every piece of content should help the reader do something
- Confident but not arrogant — we know our product well, we don't oversell
- Human — we write like a knowledgeable colleague, not a corporate brochure

Calibration scale:
- Formal ←——— **just right** ——→ Casual
- Salesy ←——————— **just right** ——→ Passive
- Technical ←——— **just right** ——→ Oversimplified

## Writing Style Rules

- **Sentence length:** short to medium — aim for 15–20 words on average, break up anything longer
- **Paragraph length:** 2–3 sentences max in articles, 1–2 in landing pages
- **Use of industry jargon:** use HR terminology freely (our audience knows it), avoid software/tech jargon without explanation
- **Point of view:** second person — address the reader as "you", use "we" when referring to Acme
- **Contractions:** yes — we're, it's, don't, you'll
- **Oxford comma:** yes
- **Humour / wit:** occasionally — a light touch is fine, never forced

---

## Vocabulary

**Words and phrases we use:**

- "your team" (not "employees" or "staff")
- "people ops" (not "HR department")
- "streamline", "automate", "save time"
- "practical", "straightforward", "built for"

**Words and phrases we avoid:**

- "leverage" — use "use" instead
- "synergy", "ecosystem", "game-changer" — too buzzwordy
- "solution" as a standalone noun — say what it actually does
- Exclamation marks in body copy

---

## Formatting Preferences

- **Heading style:** Sentence case (not Title Case)
- **Use of bullet lists:** frequently — break up information wherever it helps readability
- **Bold text:** used sparingly for genuinely important terms or key takeaways, not decoration
- **CTA style:** direct and action-oriented — "Start your free trial", "Book a demo", "See how it works"

---

## Do Not

- Do not make claims we can't back up ("the best HR software", "trusted by thousands")
- Do not use passive voice — write actively
- Do not write long introductions that delay the point — get to the value in the first sentence
- Do not mention competitor names in content
- Do not use em dashes (—) in body copy — use commas or rewrite the sentence

---

## Content Examples

Paste 2–3 short excerpts from existing content that best represent the brand voice. The AI uses these as style anchors — the more real examples you provide, the more accurate the output.

### Example 1 — [source: blog post title or URL]

Managing leave requests by email doesn't scale. When your team hits 50 people, the back-and-forth becomes a full-time job. Acme automates the whole process — employees submit requests in the app, managers approve with one tap, and the calendar updates automatically.

### Example 2 — [source: landing page or URL]

You don't need a dedicated HR team to run HR well. Acme gives you the tools to handle onboarding, leave, performance reviews, and compliance without the paperwork — so you can focus on the work that actually matters.

### Example 3 — [source: article title or URL]
